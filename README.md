Telling Stories with Data Portfolio (Spring 2023)

# About Me
My name is Lauren, and I am a second-year student in the Master of Arts Management (MAM) program. I'm originally from Maryland, and I've been living in Pittsburgh for about a year and a half. In the arts, I come from a music background, but my primary academic background is in international studies and history. 

# What I hope to learn
In the course, I hope to learn more about how to create data visualizations that are concise, clear in meaning, and effective.
