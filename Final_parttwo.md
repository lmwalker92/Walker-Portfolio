Data Source: [Americans for the Arts. "New Harris Poll Reveals that 93 Percent of Americans Believe that the Arts are Vital to Providing a Well-Rounded Education." Press Release, June 13, 2005."](https://www.americansforthearts.org/sites/default/files/pdf/news/press-releases/2005/06/New-Harris%20Poll-Reveals-93-Percent-of-Americans-Believe-Arts-are-Vital-to-Well-Rounded-Education.pdf). 

In this first chart, I want to specifically highlight the last bar/statistic that says that 40 percent of Americans "do not know how to get involved in Arts Education." Since the research for these statistics were done in 2005, I wondered if I should get a more updated statistic; Americans for the Arts did a similar study in 2018, but it seems that there was no question asked that resembled the data point that I want to develop my project from.
