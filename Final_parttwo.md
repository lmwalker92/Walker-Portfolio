Data Source: [Americans for the Arts. "New Harris Poll Reveals that 93 Percent of Americans Believe that the Arts are Vital to Providing a Well-Rounded Education." Press Release, June 13, 2005."](https://www.americansforthearts.org/sites/default/files/pdf/news/press-releases/2005/06/New-Harris%20Poll-Reveals-93-Percent-of-Americans-Believe-Arts-are-Vital-to-Well-Rounded-Education.pdf). 

In this first chart, I want to specifically highlight the last bar/statistic that says that 40 percent of Americans "do not know how to get involved in Arts Education." Since the research for these statistics were done in 2005, I wondered if I should get a more updated statistic; Americans for the Arts did a similar study in 2018, but it seems that there was no question asked that resembled the data point that I want to develop my project from.  

The National League of Cities (NLC) states that now more than ever, ["citizens are more motivated...to participate in their governments."](https://www.nlc.org/article/2022/09/12/how-to-promote-citizen-engagement-and-participation/) Participating in local government can serve as a an effective way for citizens to get involved and impact their communities in positive ways. I believe this is especially true when it comes to education, and in this context, greater funding for arts education.
In order to demonstrate the ways in which individuals who care about the arts can get involved at the local level, I will use data regarding the budgeting process from public school districts (in Maryland) in order to show ways in which individuals can get involved in subjects they care about in a tangible and impactful way.

Data Source: ["Maryland at a Glance," Maryland Population, Maryland State Archives.](https://msa.maryland.gov/msa/mdmanual/01glance/html/pop.html)

This map shows the 10 counties of MD that I will be focusing on. They are the 10 most populous counties in MD. Each county has its own public school district. 

## Amount of funding for the arts
The graph below shows the proportion of arts funding in comparison to the remainder of the budget for the four counties/school districts that provided specific budget line items. This is the data I have so far; I hope to have additional information for part 3.

## Prominence of Information for Involvement
I wanted to measure the extent to which information on budget hearings and citizen participation was available on each school district's website. High = visitors do not have to look far for information and the school district provides multiple options for involvement; Medium = visitors have to search for some information, but the district still provides some forms of engagement; Low = there is either very limited information or visitors have to look hard to find information

# User Research
## Target Audience
My target audience would be individuals who want to learn more about ways they can get involved civically. Another target audience would be individuals who are interested in learning about support for the arts, and more specifically, arts education. Since I am focusing on Maryland, the audience would also likely be MD residents, but I think some of the information regarding local government advocacy could be applicable regardless of one's location/residence.  
## Interview Script

| Goal | Question(s) to Ask|
|---|---|
| Understand if the data visualizations I created are clear to other people  | Are you able to tell what the data is saying?  |  
| Get a better sense of improvements | What can be improved to make sure the message comes across clearer?  |   
| See what already works well  | What works well in the visualizations and the overall story?  |  
| Understand my audience better | Is there anything that should be included in the story? What would you like to see included in the story? Is there anything that could make the story more compelling? | 

## Interview Findings
| Questions  |  Interview 1 (adult who is familiar with both arts education and MD counties) | Interview 2 (CMU student, not familiar with arts education)  | Interview 3 (CMU student, not familiar with arts education. ) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Are you able to tell what the data is saying?  | Yes, for the most part. The bar chart in the third visualization could be clearer. The interviewee could tell what the information was saying, but had to read the additional content a little bit more to understand the graphics.  | Yes, mostly. The third visualization was confusing at first, but the interviewee was able to figure it out eventually.  |  Interviewee saw the third visualization before it turned into a stacked bar chart, but was able to understand once I gave context.  |  
| What can be improved to make sure the message comes across clearer?  | In the third visualization (bar chart), since the proportion of arts-related funding is a small sliver, the color could be made more visible.  | Initially said the names of the counties on the map before realizing that the names come up when highlighting over each county.  | Maybe focus on larger items related to budgets (funnell, and then narrow in on the main topic/talk about budgets more generally - maybe how public school districts develop their budgets).  | 
| What works well in the visualizations and the overall story? | The top graph works well, and says a lot in terms of where the story is going. The fourth visualization also fits well.  | The first graph is probably the strongest. While the third graph was confusing at first, it shows the minimal funding of the arts in comparison to the rest of the budget items. |    | 
| Is there anything that should be included in the story? What would you like to see included in the story? Is there anything that could make the story more compelling?| Could be interesting to explore demographics of the counties, and/or testing scores.  | Nothing in particular.  | More information on budgeting in general.  | 

# Identified Changes for Part 3
| Research Synthesis   | Anticipated Changes for Part 3  |
|---|---|
| The third data visualization was probably the weakest of the four that I presented to interviewees. It took a little bit of time to understand what was going on (could also have to do with a lack of title).  | This might be the visualization that sees the most change--add a title, color contrast). I also thought of maybe just showing the budget in terms of curriculum items (because the figures in the graph currently show the entire budget, which includes facilities, educator fees). | 
| The first visualization was helpful in setting the frame for the overall story.  | This might not change much; I think it's best that it stays here as the opening visualization.  | 
| Could potentially include demographic information and/or test scores.  | Maybe add some more data visualizations focusing on additional elements of the counties/school districts I'm focusing on. | 
| Even the interviewees who weren't as familiar with arts education were able to see the minimal amounts of funding. | Add more elements so that I can communicate better with a non-technical audience. |
| Could be interesting to see more elements of budgeting | Maybe include a timeline for how some school districts go about their budgeting process, including at which stages they get feedback from the public.
| | Include a little bit more information about impact/importance of getting involved in local government and how that ties into arts ed. funding. |
