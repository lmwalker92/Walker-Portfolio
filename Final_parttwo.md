Data Source: [Americans for the Arts. "New Harris Poll Reveals that 93 Percent of Americans Believe that the Arts are Vital to Providing a Well-Rounded Education." Press Release, June 13, 2005."](https://www.americansforthearts.org/sites/default/files/pdf/news/press-releases/2005/06/New-Harris%20Poll-Reveals-93-Percent-of-Americans-Believe-Arts-are-Vital-to-Well-Rounded-Education.pdf). 

In this first chart, I want to specifically highlight the last bar/statistic that says that 40 percent of Americans "do not know how to get involved in Arts Education." Since the research for these statistics were done in 2005, I wondered if I should get a more updated statistic; Americans for the Arts did a similar study in 2018, but it seems that there was no question asked that resembled the data point that I want to develop my project from.  

The National League of Cities (NLC) states that now more than ever, ["citizens are more motivated...to participate in their governments"](https://www.nlc.org/article/2022/09/12/how-to-promote-citizen-engagement-and-participation/). Participating in local government can serve as a an effective way for citizens to get involved and impact their communities in positive ways. I believe this is especially true when it comes to education, and in this context, greater funding for arts education.
In order to demonstrate the ways in which individuals who care about the arts can get involved at the local level, I will use data regarding the budgeting process from public school districts (in Maryland) in order to show ways in which individuals can get involved in subjects they care about in a tangible and impactful way. 
# User Research
## Target Audience
My target audience would be individuals who want to learn more about ways they can get involved civically.
