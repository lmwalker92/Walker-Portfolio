# Final Project Part 1
## Outline 
For my final project, I am interested in exploring and showing how different public school districts in Maryland and Virginia fund and support arts education. I was thinking of what aspects of arts education I could do a project one, and I was reminded of a data point from Americans from the Arts that stated that over 90% of Americans believe that the arts are [an essential part of a well-rounded education](https://www.americansforthearts.org/sites/default/files/pdf/news/press-releases/2005/06/New-Harris%20Poll-Reveals-93-Percent-of-Americans-Believe-Arts-are-Vital-to-Well-Rounded-Education.pdf).
Despite this commonly-held belief, I am aware that there are many public school districts across the U.S. that do not always provide funding for the arts. Since the school districts in MD and VA are the ones I am most familiar with, I would like to look at recent budgets for a sample of counties/districts in order to see how much funding is directed towards arts education (i.e. the proportion of the budget that goes towards arts education and/or the hiring of art teachers). I would also like to include information about either the demographics of the counties/school districts I choose to include in my project, or other educational outcomes of the counties/school districts (ex: graduation numbers, attendance, etc.). I hope to demonstrate that there can be more done to improve the state of arts education in public schools, not only in MD and VA, but likely across the U.S. My call to action would likely be centered around encouraging others to increase their civic engagement, especially when it comes to the local items that affect us every day.
