# Final Project Part 1
## Outline 
For my final project, I am interested in exploring and showing how different public school districts in Maryland and Virginia fund and support arts education. I was thinking of what aspects of arts education I could do a project one, and I was reminded of a data point from Americans from the Arts that stated that over 90% of Americans believe that the arts are [an essential part of a well-rounded education] (https://www.americansforthearts.org/sites/default/files/pdf/news/press-releases/2005/06/New-Harris%20Poll-Reveals-93-Percent-of-Americans-Believe-Arts-are-Vital-to-Well-Rounded-Education.pdf).
