# Final Project Part 1
## Outline 
For my final project, I am interested in exploring and showing how different public school districts in Maryland and Virginia fund and support arts education. I was thinking of what aspects of arts education I could do a project one, and I was reminded of a data point from Americans from the Arts that stated that over 90% of Americans believe that the arts are [an essential part of a well-rounded education](https://www.americansforthearts.org/sites/default/files/pdf/news/press-releases/2005/06/New-Harris%20Poll-Reveals-93-Percent-of-Americans-Believe-Arts-are-Vital-to-Well-Rounded-Education.pdf). Despite this commonly-held belief, I am aware that there are many public school districts across the U.S. that do not always provide funding for the arts. 

Since the school districts in MD and VA are the ones I am most familiar with, I would like to look at recent budgets for a sample of counties/districts in order to see how much funding is directed towards arts education (i.e. the proportion of the budget that goes towards arts education and/or how many art teachers are hired within a given year). I would also like to include information about either the demographics of the counties/school districts I choose to include in my project, or other educational outcomes of the counties/school districts (ex: graduation numbers, attendance, etc.). I hope to demonstrate that there can be more done to improve the state of arts education in public schools, not only in MD and VA, but likely across the U.S. My call to action would likely be centered around encouraging others to increase their civic engagement, especially when it comes to the local items that affect us every day.

## Initial Sketch
The image below is a very rough iteration of one of the ways in which I plan to display the data I find. One chart type that I plan on using--as seen below--would be bar charts, as a way of illustration budget and/or staffin proportions. ![very rough sketch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122955915/218652047-754e379e-2a26-489c-b09f-7c68c61d0e00.jpg)

## The Data
Quite a few school districts make their budget information publicly accessible. In order to obtain data for this project, I plan to go through the adopted budget documents for recent fiscal years in order to see their overall expenses, curriculum breakdowns, and the number of teachers that each school district plans to hire for that upcoming fiscal year. I think it would be best to stick to the budget of a recent fiscal year in order to get a picture of how school districts are currently practicing budgeting. Some of the sources I plan to evaluate and eventually use are included below:
- Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) Operating Budget: https://www2.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/departments/budget/
- Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS) Budget Documents: https://www.fcps.edu/budget/budget-documents
- Howard County Public Schools (HCPSS) Operating Budget: https://www.hcpss.org/about-us/budgets/
- Baltimore County Public Schools (BCPS) Operating Budget: https://businessservices.bcps.org/departments/fiscal_services/budget_and_reporting/operating_budget
- Prince George's County Public Schools (PGCPS) Operating Budget: https://www.pgcps.org/offices/budget-and-management-services/operating-budget
- Henrico County Public Schools (HCPS) Budget & Finance: https://henricoschools.us/budget-finance/ 
- Loudoun County Public Schools (LCPS) Budget Information: https://www.lcps.org/Page/167905

## Method and Medium
The first step for this project will be continuing the process of collecting all of the necessary data for my visualizations. For assembling the story that will be used for my in-class presentation, I plan on utilizing Shorthand. For the creation of data visualizations, I plan to use Tableau and/or Flourish.
