# Bar Graph: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) compared to National Debt (2020)
This bar graph from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) shows the percentage of national debt compared to GDP for 37 countries. This chart allows the viewer to view a government's reported data from one year in particular, 2020. As indicated by this bar graph, Japan had the highest percentage of national debt compared to GDP, followed by Greece.

# Line Chart: GDP to Debt Ratio (1995-2021)
This line chart shows the changes in national debt compared to GDP for various OECD countries. Each country's data is listed in a separate line chart, which provides the viewer with a different, more detailed way of showing how each country's debt % has grown or decreased within a specific time frame.

# Scatter Plot: GDP to Debt Ratio
The scatter plot shows the same information from the OECD as the line chart above, but shows the change in Debt-to-GDP over time for all reported countries in the same chart, rather than in a grid of line charts. Each country is represented by a different color, with gray representing the OECD-Total, and black representing the OECD-Average. Each point on the scatter plot represents a country's debt percentage in a specific year. In order to view one country's data, the viewer is able to click on the legend or line of the country they would like to view. I chose this scatter plot because I believed that it would show a different, more comprehensive way of comparing various country's debt percentage over time. From this scatter plot, as with the bar graph, I think Japan instantly stands out as having high levels of national debt. I think the audience for this chart might be those who are already more familiar with the data.
