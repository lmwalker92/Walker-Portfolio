# Changes made since Part Two
For part three of the final project, I stuck with most of the initial wireframes that I submitted in part two. When I received user feedback in part two, the individuals I spoke to seemed to agree that the first chart titled "A majority of Americans have positive views towards arts education" was the strongest visualization. Since that was the data point that I wanted to build my story around, it remained the first visualization in Shorthand story. I also added an additional datapoint from Pew Research Center that helped me tie in some of the points I wanted to make around civic engagement. While I knew I wanted to build my story around both arts education and civic engagement, I was having some difficulties in deciding how I should bring those two elements together. Bringing in additional sources that focused on civic engagement--particularly at the local level--helped me to build out the narrative part of my story.

I added a title to the map of Maryland that looked at the counties and population numbers that I focused on for my research. In the chart that showed the amount of funding for the arts in comparison with the remaining budget expenditures, I changed the chart from a horizontal stacked bar graph to a vertical stacked bar graph. I felt like changing to a vertical bar graph helped with both the visibility/legibility and spacing of the chart. Additionally, I changed the colors: while I originally used light green and light blue to demonstrate the two different parts, I used a dark blue and gray in order to better show a contrast between the colors, and to show the minimal sliver of the budget that is specifically directed towards arts education. Additionally, since some school districts did not include specific money for the arts (or any other subject), I included a table that lists all of the fiscal year 2023 budget expenditures for each county/school district.

In my user feedback from part 2, one of the interviewees stated that they would like to see more information related to the budgeting process in general. I added a graphic based on a Canva template in order to list the general process/timeline of creating a public budget (based on Montgomery County Public Schools' budgeting process). In the last chart that describes the prominence of information for involvement and engagement, I stuck with the same visualization type that was included in part two, but added a title to describe the visualization and used different colors for 'high,' 'medium,' and 'low.' I also included my call to action, which was not present in part two.
