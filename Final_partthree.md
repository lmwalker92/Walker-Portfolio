# Changes made since Part Two
For part three of the final project, I stuck with most of the initial wireframes that I submitted in part two. When I received user feedback in part two, the individuals I spoke to seemed to agree that the first chart titled "A majority of Americans have positive views towards arts education" was the strongest visualization. Since that was the data point that I wanted to build my story around, it remained the first visualization in Shorthand story. I also added an additional datapoint from Pew Research Center that helped me tie in some of the points I wanted to make around civic engagement. While I knew I wanted to build my story around both arts education and civic engagement, I was having some difficulties in deciding how I should bring those two elements together. Bringing in additional sources that focused on civic engagement--particularly at the local level--helped me to build out the narrative part of my story.
